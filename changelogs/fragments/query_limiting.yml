minor_changes:
 - inventory - The inventory plugin now supports limiting the number of columns
   returned in the query. Users who wish to use this feature in conjunction with
   compose will need to add columns referenced by compose to the query
   additional_columns option. The default case preserves backwards compatibility
   by not limiting the columns returned. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/422)
